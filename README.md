ExersisS.java ----There is an online Exercise system
 - It has 3 types of exercises
 - Walking, Cycling, Running
System should be flexible to enhance to accommodate any type of exercise in the future.
Given an exercise for a user, System should print the calories burned for that exercise.
For e.g.
Input :
User - Philip
Exercise Type - Walking

Date : (If not provided, default to current date else date in mm-dd-yyyy format)
Output :
n calories

Use any formula to calculate the calories.

System also should support aggregated mode as well as detailed mode.

For e.g. If there are multiple exercises for the same user on same day, system should
print the sum of calories burned in aggregated mode. In detail mode, it should print all
the exercise details

Assignment 2:---â€“Create a database scheme that captures all the below requirements.
  We have multiple students learning at an academy.
  Each student should be uniquely identifiable
  The academy offers multiple courses.
  A student can take any number of courses
  A student obtains a score for each subject when finishes the course.
  This is captured along with the date and time he completed the course.
  A student can repeat the same course multiple number of times and thus earns multiple scores for the same course as well.
  
  We should be able to write queries to fetch the following details
        Average of all the scores obtained by all the students for any single given course
        Scorecard for any given student that shows all his scores for all of the courses
        Scorecard for any given student that shows only his best score per course.
        Scorecard for any given student that shows only his latest score per course.
        The best score obtained (by any students) per course along with the name of the student. Kind of the like topper of each course.
